HW4 represents the culmination of an incremental development process that began with
HW1 and progressed through HW2 and HW3. This assignment extends your HW3

calls, else clauses, and if statements. Additionally, you must update your HW1 virtual
machine (VM) to recognize and execute the EVEN instruction (OPR 0 11) as specified
in Appendix
